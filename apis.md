description: 'Celery emerged from Y Combinator in 2012 with one goal: to help you
  sell your great ideas, better. Filling a void in e-commerce, Celery has become the
  single-stop for innovative brands ??? large and small ??? to take pre-orders, crowdfund
  independently, and to continue selling before and after items are in-stock. Today,
  Celery has helped thousands of businesses launch their way by providing the tools
  to crowdfund and pre-sell independently.'
